                <p class="text-justify">
                    The <a href="https://open-earth-map.org/" target="_blank">OpenEarthMap</a> is a remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation 
                    benchmark dataset consisting of aerial/satellite images covering 97 regions from 44 countries across 6 continents at a spatial resolution
                    of 0.25&ndash;0.5m ground sampling distance for global high-resolution land cover mapping. It presents an advancement in geographical 
                    diversity and annotation quality, enabling models to generalize worldwide. This challenge extends the original RS semantic 
                    segmentation task of the OpenEarthMap benchmark to generalized few-shot semantic segmentation (GFSS) task in RS image understanding.</br>

                <p class="text-justify"> -->
                    The challenge aims to evaluate and benchmark learning methods for few-shot semantic segmentation on the OpenEarthMap dataset
                    to promote research in AI for social good. The motivation is to enable researchers to develop few-shot learning algorithms 
                    for high-resolution RS image semantic segmentation, which is a fundamental problem in various applications of RS image understanding,
                    such as disaster response, urban planning, and natural resource management.</br>

                    Task & Metrics
                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The main task of the OpenEarthMap Few-Shot Challenge is a <strong>5-shot</strong> multi-class semantic segmentation, i.e., generalized few-shot
                    semantic segmentation (GFSS) task, with <strong>4 novel classes</strong> and <strong>7 base classes</strong>. 
                    Given a <i>support set</i> of images with their labels, participants are to predict segmentation maps of all images in a given <i>query set</i>
                    (Note, the labels for the images in the <i>query set</i> are withheld and are used for evaluation).</br>
                    
                    The <i>support set</i> consists of 20 image-label pair examples, 5-set examples for each of the 4 novel classes. 
                    The labels for each image in the <i>support set</i> do not contain any of the base classes. Also, in each 5-set examples, the labels contain 
                    only one novel class (i.e., one novel class per 5-set examples). However, the labels for the images in the <i>query set</i> contain 
                    both the base classes and the novel classes.</br>

                    In this challenge, the GFSS task is in two phases: the <strong>development phase</strong>  and the <strong>evaluation phase</strong>.
                    In the development phase, the participants will be given training data for pre-training their backbone networks. The participants will use
                    the training data and a <i>support set</i> of 20 image-label pair examples to predict the segmentation maps of 30 images in a 
                    given <i>query set</i>, which contains both base classes and novel classes. Here, the participants submit their results to get performance feedback.
                    <strong>Note: participants need to submit their challenge paper to be eligible to enter the evaluation phase</strong>.</br>

                    In the evaluation phase, the participants will use the training data and a different <i>support set</i> of 20 image-label pair examples
                    to predict the segmentation maps of 80 images in a given <i>query set</i>, which also contains both base classes and novel classes.                 
                    Note that both the <i>support set</i> and the <i>query set</i> for the development phase are different from the ones for the evaluation phase. 
                    However, in terms of class definition, the base classes are the same, but the novel classes are different. Here, the participants submit their
                    results for final evaluation. The performance of the best submission from each submission account will be displayed on the leaderboard. 
                    See the <a href="#rules">challenge rules</a> for the submission format.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    For evaluation, we resort to the <strong>mean intersection-over-union (mIoU)</strong>, which is the average value over the IoUs of all the 
                    target classes. Note that the mIoU is computed over the target classes only without the background. Following the GFSS literature, 
                    we will use the following three metrics:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>base mIoU:</b> The average value over the IoUs of all the target base classes in the <i>query set</i>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>novel mIoU:</b> The average value over the IoUs of all the target novel classes in the <i>query set</i>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>average base-novel mIoU:</b> The average of the   <b>base mIoU</b> and the  <b>novel mIoU</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 
                <p class="text-justify">
                    However, in this challenge, more weight is placed on the <strong>novel mIoU</strong>. Thus, instead of using the <b>average base-novel mIoU</b>
                    score for the performance evaluation and ranking, we resort to a <i>weighted-sum</i> of <b>base mIoU</b> and <b>novel mIoU</b>, which is 
                    computed using 0.4:0.6 weights for the base classes and the novel classes, respectively (0.4*<b>base mIoU</b> + 0.6*<b>novel mIoU</b>). 
                    The weights are derived from the state-of-the-art results presented in the
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14126.pdf" target="_blank">GFSS baseline</a> adopted in this challenge.                    
                    Note that the top winners are determined not only on the performance on the leaderboard, but in addition to the novelty of 
                    their proposed method described in their submitted manuscripts.

                    The Dataset
                </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The OpenEarthMap few-shot learning challenge dataset consists of only 408 samples of the original
                    <a href="https://open-earth-map.org/" target="_blank">OpenEarthMap</a> benchmark dataset for RS image semantic segmentation.
                    The challenge dataset extends the original 8 semantic classes of the OpenEarthmap benchmark to 13 classes, which is  
                    split into 7:4:4 for <i>train_base_class</i>, <i>val_novel_class</i>, and <i>test_novel_class</i> disjointed sets, respectively
                    (i.e., <i>train_base_class</i> &cap; <i>val_novel_class</i> &cap; <i>test_novel_class</i> &equals; &empty;). 
                    See the <a href="#task">challenge task</a> for the purpose of each class split and the number of classes in each class split.</br>

                    The 408 samples are also split into 258 as trainset, 50 as valset, and 100 as testset. The trainset is for pre-training a
                    backbone network. It contains only the images and labels of the <i>train_base_class</i> split. Both the valset and the testset
                    consist of a <i>support set</i> and a <i>query set</i>. The valset and the testset contain the images and labels
                    of the <i>val_novel_class</i> and the <i>test_novel_class</i> splits, respectively.  A detailed description of the <!--OpenEarthMap few-shot--> 
                    challenge dataset can be found <a href="https://zenodo.org/uploads/10591939" target="_blank">here</a>, 
                    where the dataset can also be downloaded. The README in the <a href="https://github.com/cliffbb/OEM-Fewshot-Challenge" target="_blank">
                    baseline code</a> also explains how the challenge dataset can be used with the baseline model.

                    A GFSS framework, called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14126.pdf" target="_blank">distilled information maximization (DIaM)</a>, 
                    with a PSPNet architecture of EfficientNet-B4 encoder from the PyTorch segmentation models library is presented 
                    as a baseline model. The baseline code can be used as a starter code for the challenge submission. To run it, follow the
                    README instructions presented <a href="https://github.com/cliffbb/OEM-Fewshot-Challenge" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    After running the code, an output folder ``results`` which contains ``preds`` and ``targets`` folders of the model's segmentation 
                    prediction maps and the corresponding targets, respectively, are created. Based on the rules mentioned above, only the ``preds`` folder 
                    which contains the predicted segmentation maps in `.png` file format is required for the submission. Please feel free to contact 
                    the challenge organizers for any question regarding the baseline code.
